/**
 * The home hero: one piece of district artwork (2026-10-14; it replaced the
 * four-photo Clip Reveal slideshow, DECISIONS §6 revision). The artwork carries
 * its own title, centred, so the h1 is for screen readers and the only visible
 * copy is the two buttons, kept low and clear of the title. (The user dropped
 * the lede line on 2026-10-14; the stats band below carries the figures.)
 *
 * From lg the artwork is full-bleed under the transparent header. Below lg a
 * full-height box would crop the 16:9 artwork to its middle and cut the title,
 * so phones and portrait tablets show it whole across the top, on navy, with
 * the buttons underneath.
 *
 * The image clips in on load (CSS, `clip-in-load`) and the buttons rise in
 * after it, so nothing in the first viewport waits on JavaScript.

/**
 * Photo scrim, chalk-950 only (DECISIONS §2), from lg up where the buttons sit
 * on the artwork. The top band keeps the transparent header's nav legible over
 * the artwork's top edge; the bottom gradient sits under the buttons, over the
 * artwork's yellow lower edge (the ghost button's label measured 2.5:1 there
 * with no scrim), and is gone before it reaches the title. Measured 2026-10-14
 * against the real pixels behind each text box (worst 10%, text-shadow
 * ignored): see HANDOFF. Swapping the artwork means re-measuring.
