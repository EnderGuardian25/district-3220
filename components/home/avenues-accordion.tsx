 * Accordion Gallery (lab.damiandc.com/accordion-gallery).
 *
 * All five panels start collapsed and equal. Hovering one opens it and the
 * others give way; clicking locks it so hover stops changing things, and
 * clicking the locked panel releases it.
 *
 * Two layouts, one component:
 *  - md and up: a true accordion. A collage of four of the avenue's photos
 *    fills the panel above a solid band in its colour; the logo is a badge on
 *    the band's top edge (2026-10-13, DECISIONS §2). A closed panel shows the
 *    collage's left column, the open one all four.
 *  - below md: five columns of 78px is unusable, so it becomes a list with the
 *    logo on a tint and the colour on the left edge; opening a row reveals the
 *    description and the collage beneath it.
 *
 * `onSolid` picks the band's text colour. All five are 'light' (white) by
 * request. Community Service's amber can't carry white at AA, so its band uses
 * the darker `solid` colour (lib/home.ts CONTRAST NOTE, 2026-10-06). The blurb
 * and the number are white at 90%: 85% measured 4.26:1 on Club Service and
 * 4.33:1 on Green Life. The 'dark' branch is kept in case a future colour
 * needs it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a morph-cursor target: a collapsed panel is roughly
 * 140x520, so the cursor would inflate into a slab and fight the hover.
