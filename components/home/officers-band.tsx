/**
 * "For Interactors and club officers" — the member-facing utility band, built
 * in the Statement treatment from design/concepts.html: an inverted near-black
 * panel holding a dense hairline grid.
 *
 * The inversion is doing real work. Everything above this point is public and
 * persuasive; this is the district's working tool, and the theme flip is what
 * tells a returning member they have arrived at their half of the site without
 * needing a heading to say so.
 *
 * The grid is one background colour showing through 1px gaps, so there are no
 * doubled borders to line up and no border-collapse to fight.
