 *
 * CONTRAST NOTE: all five are 'light' (white) by request. White on Community
 * Service's #D8951C measures 2.55:1, because that amber is the one light colour
 * in the set. Applied 2026-10-06 (contrast must pass AA everywhere): that band
 * alone is darkened via `solid`, while the logo tint and the mobile edge keep
 * the true brand amber in `colour`. The fix previously noted here, #A86F12,
 * actually measures 4.24:1 and fails; #906413 is the lightest step of the same
